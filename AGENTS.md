# Bootrecov Project Specification (Codex)

## Overview
Bootrecov is a Go-based CLI and TUI application designed for Linux system engineers and power users who want reliable, inspectable boot recovery options when a system update breaks kernel or boot loader configurations.

The project was originally implemented as a Bash script to:
- Backup `/boot` to both `/var/backups/boot-snapshots` and `/boot/efi/boot-backups`
- Register a pacman hook to trigger backups before kernel/GRUB updates
- Generate GRUB entries pointing to these backups for manual boot recovery

Now being migrated to Go with Bubbletea for a full-featured interactive terminal interface.

---

## Key Goals
- Allow users to safely **boot into a previous /boot state**
- Enable full inspection of broken `/boot` while booted from a backup
- Provide a TUI for browsing, validating, and managing boot backups
- Support GRUB custom menu entry generation and removal
- Keep recovery and diagnostics decoupled from full rollback tools (e.g., snapper)

---

## Current System Architecture

### Bash Script (legacy)
- `/usr/local/bin/snap_and_backup_boot`: Main entry
- Creates timestamped copies of `/boot` in two locations
- Pacman hook at `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/boot-backup.hook`
- EFI recovery GRUB entries generated in `/etc/grub.d/41_custom_boot_backups`

---

## Go Application (bootrecov)

### Features to implement:

#### âœ… Backup Listing
- List backups from:
  - `/var/backups/boot-snapshots/*`
  - `/boot/efi/boot-backups/*`
- Show creation time, completeness (kernel/initramfs present)

#### âœ… GRUB Entry Management
- Parse `/etc/grub.d/41_custom_boot_backups`
 - Safely append/remove entries for backups
 - Ensure the custom file is a Bash script using `cat <<'EOF'` blocks
 - Ensure entries are never overwritten by default `grub-mkconfig`

#### âœ… TUI (Bubbletea)
- Navigate backup list interactively
- Display GRUB boot entry status
- View existing GRUB entries and remove them
- Flag backups with missing files (e.g. missing `initramfs-linux.img`)
- Mark backups already listed in GRUB
- Use Lip Gloss for a styled interface

#### âœ… Manual Recovery Hints
- Generate boot commands for GRUB rescue shell
- Show `linux`, `initrd`, and `search` commands per backup

#### ðŸ”œ Future Ideas
- Integrate optional mount + chroot to debug broken `/boot`
- Add support for auto-pruning old backups
- Detect failed boots via journald or `last -x reboot`
- Export to USB boot media

## Tech Stack
- Language: Go (>=1.20)
- UI: Bubbletea + Lipgloss + Bubbles
- Filesystem: os, filepath, ioutil, text/template
- No Snapper, no DBus

## GitHub
**Repo:** `git@github.com:marang/bootrecov.git`

## License
**MIT License** â€” permissive, simple, aligns with Go CLI and Bubbletea ecosystem.

## Installation (Development)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:marang/bootrecov.git
cd bootrecov
go mod init github.com/marang/bootrecov
go get github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
go run .
```

## Next Milestone
- [x] Scaffold `tui/model.go` and `tui/view.go`
- [x] Display list of EFI backups with kernel/initramfs check
- [x] Indicate if GRUB entry exists for each backup
- [x] Generate/Remove GRUB entry from UI selection

## Contributor Guidelines
These instructions apply to both human contributors and Codex agents.

### Development Practices
- Format all Go files with `gofmt -w` before committing.
- Run `go vet ./...` to catch common issues.

### Running Tests
- Execute `go test ./...` for unit tests.
- A full boot test is available via `docker compose up` under `docker/`.
  - **Do not run** this test in GitHub Actions or automated agent workflows; it requires KVM/QEMU and must be executed manually on a compatible machine.

### Pull Requests
- Use clear, present-tense commit messages (e.g., `Add GRUB entry removal`).
- Ensure `go test ./...` passes before opening a PR.

### Repository Structure
- `tui/` contains the Bubbletea models and views.
- `docker/` hosts the boot testing scripts and Compose file.
- `main.go` is the CLI entry point.
